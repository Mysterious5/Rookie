<h1>About me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>My name is John Ogunleye. I am a student of the federal uhniversity of Technology, Akure.<br/>
I study Electrical and electronics enginnering over there, a 200level student though. Its not<br/>
that easy in the university as it may seem but one thing is sure that everyone will scale through.<br/>
I will be becoming a full stack developer soon with the help of the CEO of druphub. Its been nice<br/>
meeting him. All thanks to him.<br/>
